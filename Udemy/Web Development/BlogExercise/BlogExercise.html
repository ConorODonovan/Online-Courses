		I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. You gotta think like a tree. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

<p>
Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Those great big fluffy clouds. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.

See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Just a little indication. There it is. We need dark in order to show light.
</p>

<p>
We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Let the paint work.

Put it in, leave it alone. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.

		I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. In your world you have total and absolute power.
